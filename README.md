# Simple composer package boilerplate (Just a few default files i use when creating a blank composer package)
TODO:
- copy this locally: composer create-project stilliard/composer-package-boilerplate PROJECT_NAME -s dev 
- delete these top lines once read
- git init as a fresh repo
- change TODO's in this file
- change the composer package "name", "description", etc. in the composer.json file
- start coding your classes in ./src/ and your tests in ./tests/ etc, commiting while you go. (Theres a Demo/Something class and Demo/Test/SomethingTest class ready for you to rename)
- setup a github repo and push to it
- setup travis-ci for auto testing and scrutinizer for checking for improvements
- you're done :D
